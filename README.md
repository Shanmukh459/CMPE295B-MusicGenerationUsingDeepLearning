## Project Architecture

## Project description
Music is fabricated so deeply in our well-being, and it has a great impact on improving mood, decreasing pain and anxiety, providing opportunities to express oneself emotionally. Upon hearing a familiar tune, the human body releases a neurotransmitter called Dopamine which is responsible for the feeling of pleasure and comfort. In this project, we propose deep learning techniques to create music samples. Our aim is to experiment with multiple deep learning concepts like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Transformers in generating music.

## Tech Used

- ### Deep Learning algo:
  - LSTM
  - GANs
  - Transformers
- ### Libraries
  - Music21
  - sklearn
  - Tensorflow
- ### Framework
  - Streamlit
  - Python v3.11

## Steps to reproduce
- clone the repository
- install the dependencies using below command

``` npm install streamlit tensorflow ```

- Please add other dependencies by following the above command syntax
- Once the dependencies are in place run the following command to launch the application

``` streamlit run app1.py ```

- Open the link provided in the terminal in any browser
- Provide input music file in "MIDI" format
- Select the desired algorithm to be used to generate music from the dropdown
- Submit the request
- Once the confirmation is displayed the predicted music sequence can be found in the working directory

Thank you!
